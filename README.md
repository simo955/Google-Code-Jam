## [Google Code Jam - Coding competition](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)
Code Jam is Google's longest running global coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test. Competitors work their way through a series of online algorithmic puzzles.

In this repo I upload every year my solutions for the rounds I compete. I usually have no difficulty to solve the Qualification round.
